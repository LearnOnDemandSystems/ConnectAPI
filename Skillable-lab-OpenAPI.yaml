    # Introduction 
    Welcome to Skillable Connect: LAB Edition, our core platform for creating, customizing, and managing labs. 

    ## Skillable Production API & Integration Testing
    Only lab profiles with a development status of **Complete** are consumable via API.

    Development/Integration Testing API available with all the same API calls your production API can make, but has the following settings:

    - Max Active Lab Instances: 5
    - Max Saved Labs per User: 1
    - Max Active Lab Instances per user: 5
    - Max lab duration: 30 minutes
    - Allows launching of lab profiles with any Development Status (i.e. is not restricted to a Complete development status)
    - Has a dedicated API key
    - Does not generate billable events

    ## Authenticate with API Key
    Skillable APIs offer one form of authentication: an API Key. All methods require an API Key, which must be obtained from a Skillable team member working with your organization. Our systems use this key to validate your development account. 

    Pass your API Key as an HTTP request header with the header name "api_key".

        The **ScoreActivities** command causes all scored activities in a particular lab instance to undergo scoring. Please note that this is API command is only necessary in specialized situations. In most cases, scoring is triggered by the student in the lab client and this command is not needed. However, if your students do not use our lab client, ScoreActivities provides a mechanism to trigger scoring.

        This command does not return scoring results. To obtain scoring  results, use the **Details** command.
